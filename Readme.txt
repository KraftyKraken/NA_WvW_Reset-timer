Reset_Countdown is a tool for simply clicking a button and having the time before WvW NA reset become displayed for you.

This is specifically designed for Guild Wars 2. It only tracks time for north america WvW reset too.

Expect some "lag" when you move it because the whole window is sleeping in the current version.

The current build should only work on windows 10. Sorry about that, I don't really have any others supported in first release at the moment.


To "install", grab the zip file and take the .exe out and use it from where ever you want. It should be very stand alone.

Please let Ottohi know of any bugs/incompatabilities.

Required to build from .py file are dateutil, python 3.8+, and pyinstaller.
