# What <h8> 
Reset Countdown is a tool for simply clicking a button and having the time before WvW NA reset become displayed for you.
This is specifically designed for Guild Wars 2. It only tracks time for north america WvW reset too.

# Limitations <h8> 
Only one countdown timer at the moment is shown and working at a time.
The current build should only work on windows 10. Sorry about that, I don't really have any others supported in first release at the moment.

# Installation <h8> 
To "install", grab the zip file and take the folder out and use the .exe inside from where ever you want. It should be very stand alone.
You can also create a shortcut to it that should work.

# Known Bugs <h8> 
Please let your local kraken know of any bugs/incompatabilities.\
Known:\
-Doesn't play well with MAC or Linux\
-Windows think it's evil because of a lack of cert. It's not, you can look here and see the evilest thing is that global variable.\
-Can't find icon. Sometimes it has issues. Make sure the icon AND the .exe are the same place folder level wise.\
-Slow reset. This is because of how I forced it. I'm still looking to fix this.


# How to Build <h8> 
Required to build from .py file are dateutil, python 3.8+, and pyinstaller.
Now requires an icon and file_version_info. Use what you want and simply bundle with pyinstaller.

# Buy this kraken a cookie? <h8>
Like what I've made? Please consider buying me a cookie for a job well done. Not a coffee. Sorry, I'm just not a fan. Tea's fine though.\
