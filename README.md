This is specifically designed for Guild Wars 2. It only tracks time for north america WvW reset too.

# Limitations <h8> 
Only one countdown timer at the moment is shown and working at a time.
The current build should only work on windows 10. Sorry about that, I don't really have any others supported in first release at the moment.

# Installation <h8> 
To "install", grab the zip file and take the folder out and use the .exe inside from where ever you want. It should be very stand alone.
You can also create a shortcut to it that should work.

Please let your local kraken know of any bugs/incompatabilities.

# How to Build <h8> 
Required to build from .py file are dateutil, python 3.8+, and pyinstaller.
